# scikit-learn笔记6——Cross-validation for parameter tuning, model selection, and feature selection
## Agenda
- What is the drawback of using the **train/test split** procedure for model evaluation?
- How does **K-fold cross-validation** overcome this limitation?
- How can cross-validation be used for selecting **tuning parameters**, choosing between **models**, and selecting **features**?
- What are some possible **improvements** to cross-validation?
