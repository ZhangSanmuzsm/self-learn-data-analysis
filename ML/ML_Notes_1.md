# 机器学习笔记1——了解机器学习
## Machine Learning
* Grew out of work in AI
* New capability for computers 
* Tom Mitchell (1998) Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. 

## Examples
* Database mining 
	* Large datasets from growth of automation/web.  
	* E.g., Web click data, medical records, biology, engineering
* Applications can’t program by hand.
	* E.g., Autonomous helicopter, handwriting recognition, most of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision. 
 
## Machine learning algorithms 分类
1. Supervised learning
	* 带标签 “right answers” given
	* 举例：房价预测
	* Regression: Predict continuous valued output (price)
2. Unsupervised learning
	* 不带标签
	* 举例：聚类
3. Others: Reinforcement learning, recommender systems.
